			üëãüèº Hello there,
		</p>
		<p>
			My name is Hankyu, and I am the author of this blog.

			How I got into autonomous driving:
		</h3>
		<p>I always wanted to be a scientist when I was a kid, but everything changed after I met engineering.
			I fell in love with it, even though people are doing engineering for many other reasons.
			I didn't get good grade on every class equally. I just did what I loved.
		</p>
		<p>One of them was programming, and the other was control.
			Like this, I really liked english class and still keep in touch with my freshman liberal arts (english) professor.
			Gave me chance to deal with cutting-edge technology as a club member of my university.
		</p>
		<p>Autonomous driving technologies made me stay up all night.
			Bayesian Probablity, Deep Learning, end-to-end driving model, and reinforcement learning etc.
			I'd love to apply various skillsets such as EKF and path planning algorithm.
		</p>
		<h3 class="title mb-6">
			Fun facts about me:
		</h3>
		<p>I rarely consume caffeine. I am mostly a sweet lemonade and sweet yogurt lover.
		</p>
		<p>I am not a fan of e-sport. There is stereotype that all the Korean good at it and love it.
			Most of programmer also love gaming, and people are crazy about it here. But not me. So please don't hate me for this.
