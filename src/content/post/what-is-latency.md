Latency is the time it takes for data to travel from the source to the destination. It encompasses various delays encountered during data transmission.

#### Transmission Delay

Transmission delay is the time required to send all the bits of a packet into the transmission medium. This delay is influenced by the data rate of the link.

#### Propagation Delay

Propagation delay is the time it takes for a signal to travel from the sender to the receiver. It is calculated as the ratio of the link length to the propagation speed in the specific medium.

#### Processing Delay

Processing delay is the time it takes for routers to examine the packet header and determine the best path for forwarding. This delay depends on the routerâ€™s performance and the current network traffic.
