* Active GPS receives and amplifies the GPS signal it receives from satellites by sending power to the attached GPS antenna.
    
* Active GPS devices will always have a SMA GPS port for an external antenna, which allows for the amplification of the signal.
    
* Active GPS will work better in poor coverage areas. (Areas without direct view of the sky, such as mountainous areas, and urban areas with large buildings).

* Passive GPS only receives satellite signal on their internal GPS module. (ie: listening only) It does not amplify the signal.
    
* Passive GPS will require a clear view of the sky; does not work well in poor GPS coverage areas.
    
* Passive GPS devices have Passive GPS annotated in their documentation. (ie: IBR6x0C-150M).
