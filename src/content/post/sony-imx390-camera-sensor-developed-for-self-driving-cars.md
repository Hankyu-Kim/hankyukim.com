## Sony IMX390 camera sensor developed for self-driving cars

Features of the 2.45 (effective) megapixel sensor include light sensitivity down to 0.1 lux, helping a vehicle see road signs or pedestrians on a clear, full-moon night — without its lights. It’s also got 120dB HDR sensitivity, wide enough to handle tunnels or urban night driving. It can mitigate flicker using a longer exposure time, a function that works in parallel with HDR, since both situations often occur at the same time.

Sony says the device also meets automotive reliability and safety standards. That’ll make its low-light and HDR capability important, because Europe’s automotive safety board will “include nighttime pedestrians as targets for automatic braking collision avoidance systems in 2018,” Sony says.
