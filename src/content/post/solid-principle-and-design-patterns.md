SOLID abbreviation represents :

SRP(Single Responsibility Principle) - A class should have only one responsibility.

OCP(Open Closed Principle) - Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification

LSP(Liskov Substitution Principle) - Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes.

ISP(Interface Segregation Principle) - Interfaces can be segregated for clients not depending on interfaces that they do not use.

DIP(Dependency Inversion Principle) - Depend upon abstractions, not concretes.
