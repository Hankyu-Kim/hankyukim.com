Network overhead refers to the extra data required for transmission and processing. This additional data can slow down the rate at which information is transferred across the network.

#### Protocol Overhead

Protocol overhead involves the data included in the protocol headers during transmission. For instance, an Ethernet frame's header contains the source and destination MAC addresses and protocol information, all of which can impact the overall data transmission rate.

#### Error Check and Control Overhead

To ensure data integrity, additional information is often needed for error checking and control. However, this can also reduce the transmission rate by adding to the overhead.
